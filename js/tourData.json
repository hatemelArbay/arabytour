Nestled within the Mokattam mountain in southeastern Cairo, this cave, also known as the Monastery of Saint Simon, is situated in an area known as 'garbage city' due to its significant population of garbage collectors, known as the Zabbaleen.The Zabbaleen are descendants of farmers who migrated from Upper Egypt to Cairo in the 1940s, seeking employment and a better life. Initially adhering to their agricultural traditions, they eventually transitioned into collecting and sorting the city's waste, a more lucrative venture. They meticulously sift through household garbage, salvaging valuable items and utilizing organic waste to feed their animals. This sustainable model attracted additional migrants from Upper Egypt, leading to the establishment of thriving garbage villages in Cairo.",

Initially adhering to their agricultural traditions, the Zabbaleen later found the collection and sorting of waste from city residents to be a more lucrative endeavor.
